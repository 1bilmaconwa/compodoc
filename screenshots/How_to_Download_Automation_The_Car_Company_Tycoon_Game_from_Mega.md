Next, you need to find the link to the game file on Mega. You can search for it on Google or other search engines, or use a website that lists Mega links for games. Be careful though, as some links may be fake or contain malware. Always check the comments and ratings of the link before downloading.

## Step 3: Download the file
 
Once you have the link, you can paste it into your browser's address bar and press enter. You will be taken to the Mega website, where you will see a preview of the file and its size. To download it, you need to click on the "Download" button at the top right corner.
 
If you have enough transfer quota left on your Mega account, the download will start automatically. If not, you will be asked to upgrade your account or wait for some time until your quota is replenished. You can also use a VPN or a proxy to bypass the quota limit, but this may affect your download speed and security.
 
The file size of Automation - The Car Company Tycoon Game is about 8 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet connection. You can check the progress of the download on your browser's downloads manager or on the Mega app if you have it installed.

After the download is complete, you need to extract the file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder containing the game files and a crack folder. To install the game, you need to run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions. You may also need to install some additional software like DirectX or Visual C++ Redistributable.
 
To play the game, you need to copy the contents of the crack folder and paste them into the game folder, replacing any existing files. This will bypass the Steam activation and allow you to play without any restrictions. You can then launch the game from the desktop shortcut or the game.exe file.
